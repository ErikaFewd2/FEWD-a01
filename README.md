## Hi my name is...

# Erika Sanchez


But it actually *isn't* anymore. I finally legally changed it to **Erika Pickford** after being married to *Mr Pickford* for two years. I like him a lot, so I decided I was going to keep him and steal his name. His name is **Eric.** People are always like *"Eric and Erika!?"* and we are like *"Yup, that's it, that's the tweet!"* Now its going to be even better because we have the same last name too! Comedy!

A very bad hobby of mine is posting on Reddit. I like posting funny things I write and mining Karma.


My Reddit Stats:
1. 174 days
2. 11,439 karma
3. 2 gold medals


I need to quit Reddit and start blogging funny things for real gold and real karma, or what ever the equivalent would be outside of Reddit. 


The point of this was to say that making changes to this file is not unlike posting to Reddit and I find that amusing! 

BRB going to see if I can make words bold and make lists in my Reddit comments now ...


Because this assignment requires it I will write another paragraph about myself. I don't really like writing about myself. I like *talking* about myself but writing about myself makes it seem like I like doing it on purpose and that feels cringy. Anyway, I like dressing up, going out, traveling, eating and playing Animal Crossing. Very excited about the Switch version coming out on March 20th! Is that it? Can I stop now? Oh one last thing: [Me if I were a cat in watercolor.](https://i.imgur.com/XIhmeNx.jpg)
